### Bug Fixes

* Add empty group so argo will stop diffing. ([#13](https://github.com/catalystcommunity/chart-platform-services/issues/13)) ([b9c8f25](https://github.com/catalystcommunity/chart-platform-services/commit/b9c8f2587aa4a27b1917f9b5e18e357e017b2c84))

# [1.0.0-alpha.11](https://github.com/catalystcommunity/chart-platform-services/compare/v1.0.0-alpha.10...v1.0.0-alpha.11) (2022-03-18)


### Bug Fixes

* Add ignore differences to linkerd-jaeger and linkerd-viz ([#12](https://github.com/catalystcommunity/chart-platform-services/issues/12)) ([0294c3e](https://github.com/catalystcommunity/chart-platform-services/commit/0294c3eb56976a90b52ad02f167025396b839b47))

### Bug Fixes

* Linkerd uses helm template commands to generate certs. This happens on every sync, so it goes into a loop. This commit adds the necessary ignore differences specification to avoid an out of sync loop. ([#11](https://github.com/catalystcommunity/chart-platform-services/issues/11)) ([865e29b](https://github.com/catalystcommunity/chart-platform-services/commit/865e29b5316a8247bd72fcdd913410d2f31dd15d))

# [1.0.0-alpha.9](https://github.com/catalystcommunity/chart-platform-services/compare/v1.0.0-alpha.8...v1.0.0-alpha.9) (2022-03-17)


### Bug Fixes

### Bug Fixes

* Use stringData for cert pem because the linkerd chart requires it as a string for a configmap, but we need it in a secret for the trust anchor ([#9](https://github.com/catalystcommunity/chart-platform-services/issues/9)) ([e0605c3](https://github.com/catalystcommunity/chart-platform-services/commit/e0605c387b37f175813d88337eab37d0af79e389))

* Remove trustanchor.crt value in favor of existing chart value named identityTrustAnchorsPEM. ([#5](https://github.com/catalystcommunity/chart-platform-services/issues/5)) ([46d7ddc](https://github.com/catalystcommunity/chart-platform-services/commit/46d7ddcb3cd253a1eeaaebdb0245f864595b22ac))
